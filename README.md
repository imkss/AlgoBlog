## Blogging Platform Project

 The goal of this hackathon is for individual participants to develop an advanced blogging platform.
The platform should provide robust features like user authentication, blog post management, and interactive
elements like comments, likes, and sharing. The focus is on creating a clean user interface, efficient technical
implementation, and optional advanced features.

# 1. User Authentication:
- Implement a secure admin login system. Only the admin should have the ability to log in and
manage the platform.
- Admin functionalities include creating, editing, deleting, categorizing, and overall management of
blog posts.

# 2. Blog Post Management:
- Integrate a rich text editor for creating and formatting blog posts.
- Enable users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) their blog posts.
- Ensure that the blog supports image and link integrations in posts and other functionalities
# 3. Admin Features:
Allow an admin user (such as the blog owner) to manage all blog posts. This includes creating,
editing, deleting, and categorizing posts.

# 4. Interactive User Features:
- Implement comment, like, and share functionalities for each blog post.

# 5. Advanced Features (Optional):
- Search functionality to find posts by title, content, or tags.
- Track and display view counts for each post.
- Any other innovative features adding value to the platform.
- AI Integration: Incorporate AI tools or APIs (such as OpenAI API, Google Cloud API, etc.) in any
creative way, such as automated content suggestions, automated moderation.

# Technical Specifications:

- Front-end: Use Next.js or React.js. Tailwind CSS is recommended for styling, but other component
libraries are permissible.

- Back-end: Build the server-side logic using Node.js.
- Database: Implement a NoSQL database, preferably Firebase or MongoDB.
Hosting: Deploy the final application on a free hosting platform like Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Vercel,
etc.
